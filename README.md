PHP 5.3+ wrapper for [VirusTotal's API](https://www.virustotal.com/en/documentation/public-api/). Supports the public and private APIs.
The only dependency is Guzzle 4+ (3.x is not supported).

If you need Guzzle 3 support check out [Jay Zeng's API wrapper](https://github.com/jayzeng/virustotal_apiwrapper) which this library 
is inspired by.
